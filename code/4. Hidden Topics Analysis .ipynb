There is a dining area connected to the kitchen and a living area with a massive TV and extensive DVD collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main double bedroom also includes a large TV and space for storing clothes, including hangars. Luis (who lives in a separate flat downstairs) even purchased an iron and ironing board specially at my request, which is always useful after using the separate washer and dryer also in the kitchen. Wifi worked perfectly in all rooms (Mac) and is a good speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious useful items are included like soap, shampoo, toilet roll, washer tablets, assorted cooking items, cleaning products and anything you'd expect to have in your own home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is located 5 mins from Castro Muni and 10-12 minutes from 16th and Mission BART, or takes about 30 mins to walk to the start of the commercial area of Market St. Very quiet and safe area.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt, will be staying here next time I'm in SF.\",\n",
       " \"Luis is renting out perhaps the most beautiful home I've ever seen in San Francisco. It has all the amenities I need, and then some. The location is the best in the city: you'll be living away from all the touristy junk downtown while still only a 10 minute ride on the Metro to get there. I lived a couple of blocks from there for years and love the beauty and vibe of the neighborhood. Luis was an absolute gentleman, a pleasure to chat with, and one of those hosts that truly makes you feel at home. I had a great experience -- this is definitely the only place I'll stay in San Francisco from now on. \",\n",
       " 'A great apartment convinient to the Castro, the Mission, foodie destinations, and multiple lines of public transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is very, clean and comfortable.

While we were there, it was wonderful to know he was in the ground floor apartment if we had any questions about the neighborhood or getting around the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe local couldn't have been better--centrally located to all the best sites and transportation. The apartment is located on a very quiet street with great neighbors and  has all the amenities you could ask for. Of course, if you love animals, you'll fall in love with Rocky--Luis's wonderful dog. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope to return to San Francisco soon and will certainly book our stay at this location again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

Definitely my top pick for a stay in San Francisco.  \",\n",

We didn\\'t rent a car, yet from our location we easily were able to do all the \"touristy\" things while also enjoying a very quiet, peaceful neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is well equipment, and comfortable. After picking up a few items at a local market, we were able to prepare a few home cook meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pictures on the website do not justify the roominess of the apartment. It was very comfortable, and well decorated. I truly felt at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuis also had wifi access all set up for us to use, which proved helpful for our visit as well. He was very accomodating and had ideas readily available on what we could do during our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my first experience using airbnb and I was a little nervous. Everything about the experience far exceeded my expectations, and enhanced my visit to San Francisco.',\n",

On arrival, he supplied us with fruit and all the essentials to get us by, I heard many times before we arrived that people are friendly and Luis more than lived up to this expectation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house was beautiful and I felt so at home - the house was more than a home from home with all the amenities you would need. If you are looking for a centrally located apartment then this is it. The Castro and Mission are two minutes away as is all transport.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I go back to San Fran (which will be soon) I will definitely stay in Luis' apartment. \",\n",

Luis is an excellent host and made myself my husband and our 18 month old son feel very welcome. He was always happy to give us directions and advice on where to go and how to get there. The apartment was only a few minutes walk to the trolly which was very convenient.

See you soon Luis and wishing you a wonderful holiday and Happy New Year! Sue and Bill',\n",
       " \"From the moment you approach Luis' home, you can tell he cares deeply about comfort, quality, and attention to detail. You see it in the beautiful arrangement of plants outside, the appliances and accessories in the apartment, and the extras he provides for your convenience. A friendly, caring host, Luis has a way of making you feel safe and happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation is great (a bit of walk from BART if you're coming from the airport, but very manageable), with the MUNI around the corner to take you downtown and an assortment of restaurants and cafes nearby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself is an experience. As private as you want it to be (you can raise and lower blinds as you see fit), and quite large, it features lofty ceilings and huge windows with a lot more natural light than the photos suggest. Lavishly decorated and immaculately maintained, there are blood red velvet curtains, elaborate chandeliers, giant painted portraits on the wall, and an assortment of Egyptian, medieval, and other decorations. You can sometimes faintly hear a clock downstairs that chimes in a minor key. It's all wonderfully put together. You're transported to a different world for the duration of your stay. This is the kind of place that should be featured on Airbnb.\\r\\n\",\n",
       " \"I had the pleasure of staying at the Edwardian Flat in December 2010 and have to say that I don't think I could have found a better dwelling or a better host in San Francisco than Luis.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven when bad weather caused my flight from Ireland to be cancelled and a missed connection from Boston resulted in my turning up a day late at an unfeasibly late hour, Luis and Rocky (his friendly dog) were there to greet me and give me a tour of the beautifully decorated apartment. Luis had also very thoughtfully left some provisions like bread, milk, juice and pastries which saved me from having to shop for my breakfast the next morning (as well as helping me over my jet-lag)!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment itself was spotless and contained anything a person could need for a very comfortable stay including free Wifi, temperature control, a dishwasher, a washing machine, a tumble dryer and a large kitchen with full cooking facilities for the more culinary minded.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one of SF's few rainy days, I could relax in the plush sitting room and watch one of two widescreen TVs (the other one is located in the bedroom) or choose to view a DVD from the wide selection offered, and even though the apartment is located on a quiet residential street, I was minutes away from Market Street and the bustling Castro district, making it very easy to get home after a night out!\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd like to keep quiet about this apartment for purely selfish reasons, but it wouldn't be fair! It's a gorgeous place to stay, centrally located, very competitively priced and is owned by a landlord who will ensure that you have everything you need. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are every visiting San Francisco and want the full comforts of home and more, do snap this place up if it's available.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuis, thank you for a wonderful stay, I'm looking forward to returning as soon as I possibly can!\\r\\n\",\n",

       " 'Our recent stay with Luis was fantastic!  I would highly recommend this apartment to other prospective Airbnb customers.  The location is great – a quiet residential spot within easy walking distance of restaurants, a little market, Mission Dolores park, and public transportation.  The apartment is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and has all the comforts of a home – dishwasher, laundry, coffee-maker, kitchen supplies, TVs, etc.  Luis has thoughtfully provided lots of little touches, like extra toiletries, laundry soap, extra pillows and towels, bathrobes, coffee and tea, area maps, and a list of suggested neighborhood spots.  There’s plenty of natural light, plenty of space, plenty of wireless.  And Luis has cultivated a garden out front, so it’s as attractive outside as it is inside.  Luis is such a gracious host, available right next door for questions and advice about the city and the neighborhood.  (And Rocky is a truly excellent host dog!)  It was wonderful to return every night during our stay to a real home in a lovely neighborhood with a friendly next door neighbor, instead of some impersonal hotel room in a high-rise.  I hope we’ll have a chance to stay here again!',\n",

       " 'We had a wonderful time at Luis\\' place. The apartment is just amazing! It’s located in the top flor of a typical Victorian San Fransisco house\\r\\nwith a remarkable interior design which, from what we guess, is the heart and soul of Luis himself. The location is very quiet (not a sound at night) and still just a few blocks away from the busy streets of Castro and Mission. The apartment was spotlessly clean with a huge bright livingroom, a large kitchen with every utility you may think of, and a nice bedroom with a huge comfy bed. The bathroom is very nicely decorated and feels like a hotel with all the towels and soaps and shampoos provided. Luis was a lovely host! He stayed up until 2am to be able to greet us in the street on our arrival, even though our plane was five hours late. On top of that, he had provided us with breakfast, fresh fruits, bread and pastries. Luis seems to truly love people (and of course his dog Rocky) and has a delicate way of handling things. He helped us with everything and we are still delighted by the memory of his way of calling out ”Enjoy!\" to us each morning, as we headed out do discover San Francisco.',\n",

Very beautiful, clean, organized, sunny and silent. It's like being in luxury hotel, but more cozy and private.\\r\\nThe neighborhood is extremely charming. In my opinion the best place to stay in SF. Its basically residential, has the typical geography and architecture you expect to see in SF, is very safe and well served in public transport and local commerce.\",\n",
       " 'Luis was a very welcoming host. He showed me around the flat and made me feel at home. The flat was AMAZING. Very well equipped and beautiful.

I felt very lucky to be able to stay here.',\n",

       " \"The flat was charming, we'll-appointed and spacious for my partner and to invite a few guests over for lunch.  The south-facing windows flooded the living room and dining room and yet the trees just outside provided leafy privacy.  The neighborhood is quiet but steps from Castro St, Dolores Park & the Mission--and it's right in the middle of  town so you're never too far from anywhere else.  Luis was gracious, jolly, doting, and always available.  This is the best apartment I have rented from airbnb--and I've rented many lovely places before.  Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"My parents stayed at Luis's apartment while they were visiting us in SF. The flat is well located and has a lovely entrance.

       " \"Luis is not only a marvelous host, he is also a wonderful human being. He helped this gypsy woman carry in my comical amount of luggage and shopping bags without judging or worrying about how I was about to explode these bags all over his beautiful home.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe home is even better in person than the fabulous pictures suggest. It was the lush, regal urban oasis that I needed. Within a few blocks of the house lies everything one needs- access to public transit, good coffee and food (Bi-Rite, Delfina Pizzeria, that taco place on Market), fantastic shopping spots (Cliff's Variety,  various clothing boutiques).\\r\\nEven with all this amazing access to the best of SF, the home is tucked away on a serene street with great landscaping, making it a peaceful retreat. \\r\\nThe home itself feels spacious yet cozy and has modern conveniences set amidst a Victorian sensuality.  The lighting, both natural and artificial is perfect. And oh my goddess those chandeliers are a dream to behold. I loved looking around and admiring all the different styles and eras represented in the decor- it's a delight for the artistic senses. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again, I cannot say enough about Luis- he is kind, gracious, generous and a just a wonderful person and host. I am so glad to have met him and count him as a friend. \",\n",
       " \"My parents stayed at Luis' flat - here is their review:  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent two weeks in Luis' spacious and fascinating apartment.  The warm welcome from Luis set the tone for our stay.

The rooms are large and very nicely furnished.  The kitchen and bathroom are beautiful with top of the line appliances.  There are lots of closets and the bed is comfortable.  \\r\\nWe highly recommend the apartment and would certainly stay there again when next visiting San Francisco.  Luis is a great host.\",\n",
       " \"Whenever my family comes to SF l have them stay in and Airbnb nearby. \\nThis was the best Airbnb experience I have had yet (out of dozens).\\n\\nLuis is a fantastic host. He was warm and welcoming and had great suggestions for my family on places to go and things to see. The apartment is beautiful; modern amenities, great light, and an extremely comfortable bed. We had a dinner party at the apartment with mostly friends who live in SF, and everyone was impressed with the space.\\n\\nIts a great neighborhood and the apartment is in a perfect location. Close to everything but on a quiet side street that feels out of the way.\\n\\nI can't wait to book this place again!!\",\n",
       " \"Do yourself a favor and stay in this flat if you are going to SF!  Absolutely lovely and perfect, I do not have a single criticism!  Luis is wonderful and sweet, he will get you settled in right away as well as helping whenever needed.  The place is gorgeous and completely comfortable at the same time.  There's really nothing I could have needed or wanted that isn't there.  I had a number of friends come by and everyone was so impressed!  The neighborhood is beautiful (oh and there is a jungle of flowers outside your front gate!!).  You will be on a pretty, quiet block right in between the Castro and the Mission with Market street right behind you for easy access to Muni.  Seriously - stay at this place and fall in love with San Francisco at it's best!\",\n",
       " 'Luis is an amazing host. This is the first airbnb I\\'ve stayed at with an airbnb \"superhost.\" I can say that in this instance that label is, if anything, an understatement. I felt like I was visiting a thoughtful relative or friend - who had gone out of their way to make me feel welcome in every respect, from a warm greeting, good conversation, to a variety of wonderful gestures within the apartment itself, including cereal, orange juice, milk, fruit, potato chips, a beer, other tasty drinks... and on and on. The place has a washer and drier in the unit, a full kitchen with everything you need to cook, is located in an amazing spot, which while close to Muni, the Castro, Whole Foods and Safeway, somehow manages to still be quiet, allowing me to leave a window open, enjoy the breeze and sleep hard on the amazingly comfortable bed. So the apartment itself is terrific, but the host really pushes this experience to an entirely other level of excellence.',\n",
       " \"Luis was a wonderful host, and the location could not be better!  A block or two from the main drag of the Castro, and a 5-10 minute walk to the hipster haven that is the Mission.  We made a last minute plan to visit San Francisco and his response was always fast, clear, and helpful!  The place is even better then in the pictures, on a very lovely quiet street flanked by a gorgeous sidewalk garden.  Palm trees and flowers greet you every time you exit and enter this charming and glamorous apartment!  The apartment is spacious and light filled on the 2nd floor of a classic SF Edwardian building.  There are classic sculptures and lovely artwork and furnishings. Everything in the unit is in tip top shape, the kitchen and bathroom is nicer then my own at home!!  Luis left us snacks, fruits, and beverages and even a gorgeous bunch of flowers to welcome us!  He was available for any questions, but not in our face at all.  He was so lovely, we opted to have a coffee with him the last day to hear his stories about the neighborhood's historic past!  I would totally stay here again, and couldn't give Luis a higher testimonial.   He and this place is a true sparkling gem in Airbnb crown!  \\r\\n \",\n",
       " 'OMG! Luis is the super hosts super host! Do yourself a favor and stay in this lovely flat.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuis is a fantastic person who welcomed us with open arms together with his dog Rocky. He had prepared the fridge with berries and almond milk. Fresh towels, new soaps and snacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never had a better Air-bnb stay and will definitely stay in this apartment again if i go back to San Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation is perfekt, bed is nice, large intresting apartment with a lot of natural sunlight.',\n",
       " 'Luis was an excellent host!  He really made my boyfriend and I feel welcome to the apartment and San Francisco.  The pictures do not do the place justice.  We were both so impressed with the decor and amenities.  Everything was super clean, comfy bed, great linens and cable TV too!  It was a fun and classy place to recharge before exploring the city.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFantastic location too, close to all the shops and bars in the Castro and just a short walk to the Mission.  Perfect spot.       ',\n",
       " \"The overwhelmingly positive reviews for Luis and his apartment are the truth. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable and it comes fully stocked. Luis is the best host I've had of my AirBnB experiences and I'd highly recommend you stay here.\",\n",
       " \"This was the best place I've ever stayed with on AirBnB. Great location close to Castro/Market and Dolores Park, wonderfully over-the-top interior with chandeliers in the bedroom, and the host was extremely friendly and helpful. He had even stocked the fridge with dairies, fresh berries and a six-pack of Steam!\",\n",
       " \"Wow.  I cannot express the exquisite nature of this flat.  The space is impeccably clean, beautiful, inviting, comfortable, and loaded with natural light.  The location is perfectly walkable to restaurants and transportation.  Luis is a gracious host who makes you feel like family. The flat is filled with surprises that I won't want to ruin for you. But they are fabulous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need a place to stay get in here immediately.  Easily my best experience on AirBNB. \",\n",
       " \"A wonderful experience, Luis was an amazing host and made us very welcome even providing snacks, fresh fruit and juice which was very welcome after long flights! His flat was incredible - amazing decor, clean, comfortable and in such a great neighbourhood, close to transport links and with great shops, parks, eating places all within easy walking distance. My daughter and I both felt we got a good taste of the real San Francisco! Louis was also a great source of advice about what to do - we had great fun at a local Sunday street closure/ neighbourhood street party following his advice! Not something we would have even heard about if staying in an inner city hotel! Thank you, Luis, for making our time in your beautiful city even more memorable! Please give Rocky, your dog, a big pat from us! We would have no hesitation in recommending Luis' flat to anyone wanting an authentic San Francisco experience!\",\n",
       " \"Beautifull appartement, well located.  Luis and Rocky welcome us with fresh press orange juice and fruit salad. \\nThe appartement is clean and have everything needed...even a nespresso coffee machine!!  \\nI'll go back to Luis place on my next trip to SF!\",\n",
       " \"This was my beautiful home away from home for 11 weeks this summer while I worked as an intern in the Financial District. I am hoping to relocate to SF after I complete graduate school and I wanted to spend the summer living in a residential community that I could imagine myself being a part of if/when I become a San Franciscan. I doubt I would have done as well at achieving that goal if my accommodations had been arranged by the mayor himself. The amazing neighborhood and gorgeous flat made it easy to fall in love at first sight; the fabulous hosts (Luis and Rocky) made it almost impossible to leave. Neighborhood - a quiet residential street where everyone seems to know everyone but no one meddles in others' affairs; a short walk to beautiful Dolores Park as well as Muni metro stops at 18th & Church (J) and the Church and Castro stations (K, L, M, T). My commute was about 25 min. during peak transit hours. The flat is a very short walk to numerous coffee shops and eateries on both 18th St. and Market St. Safeway and Whole Foods are a 15 min. walk and are also accessible via the F-line street cars that run along Market St. Housing – probably the best way to summarize the flat is to share the reaction that my college friend who has lived in San Francisco for ten years had when she saw where I was living. “You ... you have this whole place?” (pause) “to yourself?” I nodded and admitted I was spoiled. My friend: “You’re not spoiled. You’re just really, really lucky to have found this.” SF has a reputation for difficult-to-find accommodations for a reason but you won’t be realizing any of them while staying here. The gorgeous kitchen has everything you might need to prepare a meal and many things you don’t: Nespresso machine, coffee maker, blender ... even re-usable grocery bags if you didn’t bring your own! The bedroom is move-in ready: tons of closet space, an iron and neatly stowed ironing board, and a superbly comfortable bed (no lie, I made my husband go mattress shopping with me within a week of returning home ... the bed was THAT comfortable). The bathroom is similarly well-appointed and very, very clean. Host(s) – ok, so Luis is technically the only host, but his pup Rocky is also an excellent ambassador (and neighborhood watchman). When I arrived Luis greeted me like a long-lost friend, helped me heave my luggage up the stairs, and then left me to explore. Thankfully, though, he was never more than a phone call or text message away. Luis is a superhost for a reason – fresh berries, orange juice, and snacks awaited this weary traveler on check-in and the attention to detail didn’t stop there – from band-aids to cotton swabs, sandwich bags to salad dressing, Luis had the flat supplied with what I needed even before I knew I needed...\",\n",
       " 'He was so kind.   The house is beautiful, clean, well located.   All clean, with a lot of extras, services, good mood.  Love the experience.  Was a real San Francisco living for a coulple of days.  Very recommended.Thanks for everything',\n",
       " 'Luis was an excellent host, attentive and lively. The appartement was perfect for us, exactly as described and well located in a quiet neighbourhood. I would certainly go back on my next visit to San Francisco. Merci pour tout.',\n",
       " \"Luis seemed almost as anxious for us to arrive as we were to get there!  What a wonderful greeting with hugs and tail-wagging (Rocky, the pup, not Luis)!  We were immediately taken to our home for the next 8 days where Luis showed us all the amenities -- they were LEGION.  Luis supplied us with a generous amount of bottled water, snacks, cookies, berries, and coffee fixin's.   He went out of his way to make us feel at home.  Absolutely everything we needed was not only available but in pristine condition.  We were gobsmacked!  The pictures do not do justice to this oasis. The beds - including the sofabed -- were SO comfortable.  The house is located on a quiet (for a major city, that is) street in The Castro.  Safe and lovely.  Close to lots of shops and eateries.  Luis is right downstairs and eager to help when needed.  We are RUINED for any other AirBnB!  We will return to San Francisco JUST to stay here again.  \",\n",
       " 'We had an amazing stay in Luis Edwardian palace! The place is everything you need and in an excellent location. But to top it all off is Luis himself! An amazing host that made us feel so at home. We have made a new life long friend in Luis and his trusty companion rocky! ',\n",
       " 'My husband and I stayed at Luis\\' place during the latest SalesForce conference.  We picked it because the pictures looked nice, the reviews were great, and it was conveniently located to public transport and tons of nice restaurants.\\r\\nWe were not disappointed.  The condo is wonderfully comfy.  Teh decor makes you feel at home and not in some sterile environment.  All of your needs are anticipated...  From the umbrellas at the front door (so handy on that one rainy day) to the fresh squeezed O.J. and berries in the fridge, to all the toiletries most people don\\'t pack (soap, shampoo, Kleenex).  If something goes wrong (like when you don\\'t close the washer\\'s door tightly enough), Luis is minutes away, here to save the day... and the laundry load!\\r\\nOur best surprised was the bed.  We\\'ve never had bad experiences at AirBnB before, but this was over the top!!!!  The bedding was really soft and the mattress was new with a great pillow top.  Add to this that the condo is located in a very quiet street and you have a recipe for a great night of sleep.  After long days working and exploring, it was wonderful to be able to wake up fully refreshed the next day, ready to start over.\\r\\nWhile my husband was at the conference, I \"worked from home\" and I had no issue doing so using the wi-fi.  At some points, we would both be VPN\\'d in and never had any hint of performance issues.  \\r\\nThe condo\\'s location close to Market Street and Church Street are great to grab public transport.  It was a quick, reliable ride to the Moscone Center or to dinner on 24th street.\\r\\nLuis and 4-legged Rocky are great hosts.  Luis will give you great advise on places to visit (beware of Thorough Bakery....  you might need an intervention after visiting there).  The neighborhood is full of places to enjoy, from yoga studios, restaurants, coffee and tea houses, and Mission Dolores Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a wonderful stay and would recommend this to anyone wanting to experience San Francisco.',\n",
       " \"We can't think of a better and more beautiful way of spending time in San Francisco than in Luis' gorgeous, tastefully decorated and lovingly kept dream apartment. The only letdown is that we had to leave already and won't have Luis sweet energy around us! Best Airbnb experience yet, and there have been many great ones before. \",\n",
       " \"I had the most amazing stay at Luis'! He, and his adorable pup, welcomed me with open arms. He had fruit, coffee, snacks and wine waiting on me once I arrived. I couldn't have asked for me. I was so sad to leave. I would stay here every time if possible. It was the perfect relaxing space to come back to after long days at work. \\n\\nLuis was always available and checked on me to ensure I was having a great time. I can't say enough great things!\",\n",

Luis is a delightful person, who has thought of everything a guest might need (and more), with great attention to detail in decor, comfort, appliances and additional treats such as fresh fruit and berries, juice, locally brewed beers and a great selection of snacks. We agree with other reviewers, this is a wonderful place to stay and Luis is an exceptional host. Luis’ eclectic and personal style (not to mention painting talent) makes the place complete. The location is perfect for discovering and accessing San Francisco and the quiet and friendly street is filled with perfectly painted San Francisco Edwardian houses. Thoroughly recommended!',\n",
       " 'Terrific house , excellent location , warm and friendly host - Luis was great with his instructions , his really non-intrusive nature, yet being available all the time.

My mom stayed in the main bedroom and I slept on the fold out couch bed which was all set up for me and was very comfortable. The photos give a good indication of what the apartment looks like, very well decorated and clean. We used the kitchen to make Thanksgiving dinner with our family that lives in SF. It was well stocked with all the pots, pans and tools we needed. The location is also perfect. Very close to Mission dolores park, walking distance to many cafes and restaurants and also very easy to hop on the street car and head into downtown. The apartment has two locking gates leading up to the front door so also very safe. Would definitely recommend! ',\n",
       " \"I was looking for a distinctly San Franciscan home for my parents that was close to my neighborhood. Luis's space is lovely and well situated.

Luis was a gracious host and stocked the apartment with lots of amenities. I hope to bump into you on the street soon!\",\n",

We were easily able to walk to all our favorite places. The flat is beautiful, clean, and very spacious. Luis stocked his flat with everything we needed. This made it very comfortable and easy to make a meal in with groceries from neighboring Bi-Rite Market. I cannot say enough wonderful things about Luis and his apartment.

One day, we were on the trolley headed downtown & I thought, \"OMG. What\\'s the nono time for parking on the other side of the street?!

After texting my OMG, Luis not only moved our car for us...He also saw the parking ticket I got the night before for being a dumbass who forgot to put the permit on the mirror.

I fell in love with him even before we met:) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe apartment is even more gorgeous than in the pictures; large rooms with really high ceilings and lots of windows and light makes it so nice and airy. The chandeliers are to die for, and there are so many little things worth paying attention to. Beautiful bed and lovely linens, bath towels etc - plenty of everything, and Luis even provided for water, juice, milk, tea, potato crisps, coffee etc. etc. The kitchen was big and well equipped, so we could have made dinner if we had wanted to. The washer and dryer was a big bonus for us travelling from overseas with lots of luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place is situated on a lovely, quiet, safe one block street close to Muni, BART and the old and famous street cars (originally from Milan), that runs from Castro to Fisherman's Wharf, so you can get everywhere easily. We walked up and down the hills, even to the Golden Gate Park and my husband had a morning tour up to Twin Peaks. Lots of lovely shops, cafés, restaurants in the area, several corner shops and also very close to Whole Foods and Safeway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we ever come back to SF, we would definately contact Luis again, and I wish him and Rocky the best, and hope that only sweet and kind guests will come his way.\",\n",

The location is ideal, just a short walk from the Castro Muni Station and Dolores Park.  And the real kicker is Luis, the most charming and wonderful AirBnB host I've encountered.  He was always available if I had questions or wanted to chat, yet I always had a wonderful sense of privacy.  He's an amazing care taker and decorator with a great sense of humor: running into him on my way to work in the evenings was always a highlight of my day.

The bed is firm and comfortable and the bathroom, supplied with an abundance of high grade towels, is clean and user friendly.

He even had breakfast items available and so much bottled water for our days around the city, which was most appreciated. I wish we could have enjoyed more of what he put together for us. The location was ideal. So many great areas are easily walkable (The Castro, The Mission, Haight Ashbury, The Painted Ladies). For areas further away, Uber was always available in 3 minutes or less. And despite being so accessible to the many active areas, Ford Street was beautiful and peaceful. We would stay with Luis again in a heartbeat.

Giving to this feeling is the wonderfully comfortable bed with several choices in pillows including a very good orthopedic pillow destined to support you neck. In addition, there is also a beautiful and well appointed kitchen with high end appliances.  In which Luis provided bottled waters, fruits, condiments for cooking and a fun box of Halloween cookies ( I\\'m telling you, Luis and his place just make you smile). \\r\\nWe also enjoyed the excellent walk-ability to some great boutique  restaurants, stores, yoga and little gyms. As well as wonderful scenic walks of classic SF hill top homes, city architecture, and some great views, if you like to urban hike up some hills.\\r\\nWe would definitely stay here again in this lovingly well cared for home.

       " 'Luis (and Rocky the dog) is a brilliant welcoming host. He made us feel very at home in his beautiful apartment. The decoration is extraordinary and even though it is much bigger than it looks in photos it still feels very cosy. The neighbourhood is great- in the heart of the Castro, a short walk from The Mission district and well connected to public transport. ',\n",
       " 'Luis was a great host.  We felt very welcome immediately.  Luis greeted us with a big smile, fresh flowers and fruit and cookies, along with bottled water, various teas, fresh orange juice, an espresso machine.  This is a must stay for any couple visiting the area.  The rooms are decorated in true eclectic style, tasteful and whimsical,  just wonderfully done.  Bed was very comfortable, plenty of towels, kitchen was well appointed.',\n",
       " \"A fantastic apartment in an incredible location near the Castro. Luis was the perfect host - fresh fruit, OJ, chocolate, water, cereals, jams, milk, etc., all provided so there was no need for us to rush out after arriving tired, just to stock up with essentials. We know the area reasonably well, having been to San Francisco several times before, so didn't need to bother Luis too much (not that it would have been a bother), but if we needed him he was there. Highly recommended. If we return we will definitely be looking to stay here again if available.\",\n",
       " \"Luis was without doubt the most welcoming host I have ever met. From putting the Australian flag up outside the house during my stay! To stocking the fridge with fresh berries and orange juice and even bringing thanksgiving dinner up for me when I was there in my own, I don't think there is anything more he could've done to make me feel more at home... The stay was fantastic, house was immaculate and as described, communication was easy and check in smooth as butter. Easy 5/5 every day!!\",\n",
       " \"11/30 - 12/07 \\n\\nWe make frequent trips to this incredible city every year and absolutely loved this apt. Luis's wonderful flat is perfectly located for those who want to explore San Francisco. A few blocks to the Muni trains buses and Streetcars that will take anywhere in the City. Situated between the Castro and the Mission with restaurants, nightlife and great theaters. Or just chill with a in this charming space that Luis has lovingly created. A well stocked kithcen was perfect for preparing meals. Bi-rite Market and Whole Foods are a few blocks away for any items yet u may need. Plenty of dvd's and cable for a quiet night a home. Or curl up with a book on the comfortable sofa. Th neighborhood is very quiet even though you're only a few blocks for the scence on Valencia and Delores Park. We loved our stay and hope to return soon. \",\n",
       " 'Luis was very welcoming and his apartment is amazing as were all the amenities he provided -- and a very easy, pleasant and safe location to access public transportation, dining and services.

       " \"Luis' home is a superb apartment, fantastically well equipped, on a tree-lined quiet street, yet very close to the action in the Mission and Castro neighborhoods.  It is, by far, the best airbnb spot we have managed to find in San Francisco in the last couple of years, and we have stayed at several very good ones.\\r\\nLuis was a very kind, generous and gracious host, and accommodated our delayed arrival on New Year's Eve.\\r\\nIf you can snag this spot for your stay, do so!\",\n",
       " \"Luis was an amazing host. He was lovely and very accommodating. His flat was perfect for the two of us and was an amazing place to stay. I'd love to come back and stay again. \",\n",
       " \"Luis' listing is a feast for the eyes. It is amazingly appointed! So many great things to see and take in. Luis also set me up with fresh-cut fruit and other extras that added to the ease and comfort of my stay. He was a great host! \\n\\nThe listing is also centrally located, in the heart of everything. You will be surrounded by great restaurants and all comforts you will need for a great stay. I hope to stay here again. \",\n",
       " 'Luis defines \"super host.\" He bent over backward to make my wife and I feel at home. He and his adorable concierge Rocky met me when I arrived and showed me his wonderful place. Everything one could need to hit the ground running.  The pantry was stocked, much to my surprise, and he even brought up a bottle of Prosecco for my wife and I to enjoy.  He is very available if you need to communicate with him.  The apartment is only a few blocks from Castro street and the Muni Station.  Very easy for me to get downtown from there.\\n\\nI have to say our stay here was terrific and we would definitely stay again when we come back to San Francisco.  ',\n",
       " 'Luis is a warm, thoughtful and generous host! The bed was extremely comfortable and the kitchen well stocked for longer visits. I spent 5 nights for a work trip and enjoyed the fresh fruit he provided every morning!',\n",

       " 'Perfect flat in the Castro. Plenty of space, fantastic amenities and location, and Luis was a perfect host.',\n",
       " \"I booked this place for my parents for a week and they LOVED it. Wonderful location with many neighborhoods accessible by foot or a short Lyft ride, and the house itself was awesome. Comfy bed, good shower, lots of space and sunlight. Luis warmly welcomed by parents to the apartment and had a lot of nice little touches for them, like some berries in the fridge and snacks and water bottles. Luis' communication before the stay and during was excellent too. Really happy with this place and I'd book it again!\",\n",
       " 'My mom and sister enjoyed their stay so much! The apartment is centrally located, easily accessible and also quiet. A great find!\\n\\nThey loved the clever placement of different things and felt there was great care put forth for their comfort. The motion sensors lights on the floor boards and other places impressed them. The quirky style also made them smile. \\n\\nAnd they appreciated the fruit, water bottles and prosecco. \\n\\nThough we never met the host, we met his friend who welcomed us and made the check-in process easy. The check-out process was easy and quick, too. \\n\\nNext time an out-of-towner visits, I will recommend this place. \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Luis place is absolutely perfect! You feel like you are at home. The amenities are unbelievable and the home is very clean. It is exactly as pictured and described. The location is close to great food, shops and places to explore are within walking distance or transportation stops. Luis was immediately available for any needs and a great resource for our visit to SanFrancisco. A perfect place.',\n",
       " \"I frequently stay in AirBnb's and I can hands down say that Luis was the best host I've ever had. The apartment was beautiful - clearly a lot of love and attention has gone into it. The welcome spectacular - plenty of food, drink and all of the small things like washing powder, hairdryer, curlers etc. which make an AirBnb stay great. Luis himself was incredibly helpful - and went out of his way to accomodate parking for us. A truly lovely man and a really great stay, which genuinely felt like a home from home!\",\n",
       " \"I've stayed in many Airbnb properties around the world, but my stay in San Fransisco topped them all. Luis (and Rocky!) are the best hosts I've ever encountered - making sure we got in safely, stocking the apartment with lovely treats and always being on hand to help us out. Location wise, the apartment couldn't be better placed to explore San Fransisco (particularly the wonderful Castor and Mission districts) while feeling tucked away in a quiet and leafy street. \\n\\nThank you so much Luis for making my birthday trip so wonderful - I couldn't recommend a stay more highly and am already dreaming of a return visit!\",\n",
       " 'What an absolutely gorgeous place to stay in San Francisco - much better than a hotel room. There is everything in Luis place that you could want - a comfortable bed, a great kitchen, comfortable lounge in which to relax after a hard day sightseeing. It is only ten minutes walk to the restaurants and there are plenty to choose from.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely gorgeous place, quintessential San Francisco. My favorite airbnb that I have stayed at. I stayed here while preparing for my thesis defense and I attribute some of my successful defense to the wonderful stay I had (with such a lovely host), giving me the opportunity to focus in such great surroundings! Highly, highly recommended!! ',\n",
       " 'I have visited San Francisco a few times now, but never have I enjoyed it so much - and it is all due to having the most wonderful stay at Luis\\'s beautiful place. If you truly want to experience San Francisco, don\\'t stay in an expensive downtown hotel, stay in Luis\\' home. It is one of those gorgeous Californian houses that come to mind when you think of San Francisco, and you really get to experience the best of both worlds by staying here: the charm, excitement and cool of the Castro and Mission neighbourhoods (which are within walking distance) or jump on the MUNI or streetcar and you will be downtown in less than ten minutes. The house itself is clean, spacious, and equipped with everything that you could possibly need for a short or long stay. It\\'s also just so charming! As for Luis - he is the definition of a \"superhost\": super friendly, helpful, and always there if you need any advice or assistance. He also very kindly provided us with fruit, juices, breakfast items, etc. for our stay. Thank you  so much Luis (and Rocky the dog) for a most wonderful stay. We will always remember the trip fondly and look forward to staying again when we come back to San Francisco. ',\n",
       " \"The place was amazing and Luis's kindness and personal touches pushed it over the top.  The bed and pull out were both very comfortable.  The kitchen was fully equipped including spices, tools, and other essentials that made cooking breakfast easy and delicious.  Luis also provided coffee to jump start our mornings.  The house in Castro was far enough off of Market Street to be quiet at night but was still very close to restaurants in Castro and The Mission.  Truthfully, if you didn't want to go farther than a block, Kitchen Story provided two of the best meals we had in San Francisco.  The house is a short uber ride into the heart of the City.  I can't recommend this place enough.  We would absolutely stay here again.\",\n",
       " 'Fantastic little 1BR, great for a single or couple!  Luis is an expert innkeeper & will do all the little extras to make your stay enjoyable.  ',\n",
       " \"Luis's house is situated in one of the best locations in San Francisco. It is a very cosy house with all the amenities. The house is incredibly well-stocked with tonnes of fresh food, juice and fruit to eat. The bed was comfortable and Luis helped me out with receiving a package also. It's 100% worth it, and if you're thinking of booking – just book.\",\n",
       " \"Luis is a wonderful, friendly host. He's available if you need him, full of ideas if you need suggestions on what to do, but he's not at all intrusive. The apartment is immaculately-decorated and gorgeous, it looks just as the pictures show. There are low motion-activated lights set around the floor molding, which is a cool idea - saves you from having to flip bright lights on in the middle of the night (or risk stumbling into furniture!). \\n\\nIt's located just a few blocks from the Mission and the Castro, but it's tucked away on a side street so that it's quiet, even on a Friday and Saturday night the week before Pride. This is a truly fantastic location for exploring both of those vibrant neighborhoods on foot. \\n\\nLuis had a few groceries waiting for me - bananas and bagels and such - which was such a help; I came in completely exhausted from the first half of my trip, and it was a relief to not have to run right out and find dinner. \\n\\nI'm a single woman who traveled alone, which I don't do often. I felt completely comfortable and safe in the apartment; the street is quiet and low-traveled, and there are two lockable gates before you get to the (locked) apartment door. I also felt completely safe walking around alone in both the Castro and Mission in the day. I did request an Uber for some evening trips, though that was more to avoid sidewalk crowds, or because I was tired, than safety concerns. \\n\\nI highly recommend renting Luis' place if you have the chance. It's a nifty apartment in a really diverse, vibrant area of town, and I'm so glad I stayed here! \",\n",
       " 'Luis and Rocky\\'s place has set the bar extremely big for all other Air BNB experience. Luis is a wonderful person, and welcomed us warmly into his absolutely stunning home. He thought of everything - bathrobes, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee, band-aids, (Website hidden by Airbnb) all there! The rooms are beautiful, with wonderful art and very comfortable beds and furnishings. The bathroom is lovely! And the location - cannot be beat! So much fun to be in the Castro (we were there for Pride!), and easy to get to everything and anything around SF and beyond. We had so much more space than in a hotel, and it was just a perfect experience.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat, and cannot thank Luis enough for inviting us into his home! If you\\'re reading this - stop and hit \" reserve\" - you won\\'t regret it!',\n",
       " 'We had an amazing stay at Luis and Rocky\\'s place! Luis was there when we arrived to greet us and give us a tour of his fabulous house.  He has an amazing eye for detail not only with his unique decor but with his instructions for his appliances and all the accommodations he had for us. Parking was very easy. Street was nice and quiet, but a few blocks away it\\'s nice and busy if you want to explore. When we left Luis even saw us off at a ridiculous early hour like the gentleman he is. He definitely exceeded all our expectations! I would highly recommend staying at his house if you want to meet one of the nicest guys around, be extremely comfortable,  feel like you\\'re living in an amazing museum,  and want to see how the \"locals\" live in a great neighborhood! I wish we could move in! Also a shout-out to Rocky for being an adorable mascot! This airbnb is definitely our top favorite out of everywhere we have stayed. We love Luis and Rocky! ',\n",
       " \"Incredible doesn't even begin to describe Luis's perfect Edwardian home. We stayed there July 2017.  Luis was the perfect host. From the moment we arrived, in the evening, Luis met us, a parking space & pass in hand ( he mentioned we might need, and at such a reasonable price!). He is so thoughtful and fantastic . His home has every amenity you could ask for, and more. Fresh OJ, Great towels, robes, floor lights, coffees, cereals, books, even Band-aids! He gave us suggestions on places to eat & see. Luis spent the time to show us where everything was and  how they worked. The decor was most unique and everywhere you looked you saw another beautiful piece. It is on a quiet, street in a fantastic neighborhood, that was easy to get anywhere. We could move in right now! Talking to Luis, and meeting Rocky, was a sweet bonus. Thank you Luis!!\",\n",
       " \"Luis is a perfect host. He is very communicative from the moment you book until the moment you arrive. He sent us his cell phone number as soon as we booked and was happy to answer any questions we had. \\nHe is present for check in and check out and is always close by if you have any questions while you are staying in the apartment. \\nThe amenities available in the apartment are amazing. Breakfast cereals, cookies, four different types of milk, fresh coffee, tea, breads, fresh fruit. I could go on! We had breakfast in the apartment every morning and it was all provided by Luis. He even remembered that we were there to celebrate my partner's 40th and had bought us two bottles of Proseco. He's just very thoughtful. \\nThe apartment is in a great location, a quick walk to the Castro, Mission District, Dolores Park. \\nWe had a great week here and would definitely stay here again if we ever get back to San Francisco. Thanks Luis!\",\n",
       " 'Luis has been a great great host. After 18 hours in planes and airports to arrive  with the fridge already full of food and drink was very much appreciated ! The place is gorgeous and eclectic : the pictures will give you an overview, but it is even better when you are there. It is well located in SF: you have two buses and one tram at 5 min walk that lead you directly downtown within 20 minutes. On top of that, Luis has been very kind and warm to us, always there when a service was needed, always cheerful. It could not have been better !',\n",
       " \"You should stay here. The position is central within walking distance of the street cars and metro. The street is quiet and peaceful dispite the location. Luis is a lovely host who couldn't be more helpful and kind, and the place is stunning with everything you could ever need.\",\n",
       " 'We have stayed in a number of Airbnbs in the US and Europe and all have been great but this one truly stands out. The spacious apartment is equipped with every convenience and the kitchen is well stocked with food which we were encouraged to enjoy. Luis is the perfect host - friendly, helpful and seems truly interested in making sure his guests enjoy their stay.',\n",
       " 'We had a wonderful weeks stay in Luis apartment, we were there to get married at City Hall, and Luis made everything very special for us, Prosecco in the fridge and lovely flowers. The apartment is really spacious and the best equipped one we have ever stayed in, everything you could want in the kitchen and decorated in a really personal way. It is within easy walking distance of bars and restaurants and plenty of public transport options. We used Uber a few times which worked really well. Luis is there in the apartment below if you need him, but maintains privacy when you want it. We felt really at home here in this great neighbourhood and would not hesitate to recommend it to our friends. We loved San Francisco and we loved 4 Ford Street, it made our celebration even more special.',\n",

       " \"I loved my stay at Luis's! The apartment is incredibly clean and Luis had the kitchen stocked with snacks, coffee, bottled water, and all kitchen utensils, which was really great after arriving later at night. Luis and Rocky were kind enough to meet me after my late flight and show me around the apartment and answer any questions. Luis is a wonderful host and Rocky is the sweetest dog!\\n\\nThe motion activited floor lights were amazing so that I didn't have to search for switches in the middle of the night. It also has 2 locked gates outside prior to reaching the front door which made me feel very safe.  Traveling as a single female, I never felt uncomfortable in this neighborhood. The apartment is in a great location, close to everything (transportation, great restaurants, parks, bars, gyms, etc.) but on a quiet street. Overall, it became one of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco. I will definitely stay again on my next trip.\",\n",
       " 'This was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn’t have asked for a better place or host! Loved the eclectic decor which looks better than the photos.  He has put so much thought into all the small but important touches like amenities, motion detection floor lighting, comfortable bed and linens, well stocked kitchen, etc. The area is central to shopping and you can walk to some of the best restaurants in town!  Don’t miss Kitchen Story for brunch and Frances for dinner! We will definitely return!',\n",

Great kitchen, high ceilings, excellent bed and shower. Work space not only appropriate but faced a window with a view of hummingbirds. And to top it off, a great location for using public transit. Lots of nice restaurants and shops, including a good grocery and an excellent bakery, in the surrounding area. We would definitely stay there again.']"

It's a little confronting at first, but we never had any issues whatsoever and we came and went at all hours during our four night stay. We actually noticed that at night time less people seemed to be out. If you go a few blocks either way the vibe changes entirely, and it is a really quick walk to Union square and also to the metro station.\\nIn terms of the room itself we were very happy with it. The room was tidy, and had a tv, sink and refrigerator. The room was also serviced daily which meant fresh towels and our bed was made for us. The bathrooms were just down the hall and they were also cleaned daily. \\nOverall we were happy with the hotel, the neighbourhood wasn't the best but as above we never had any issues with this.\",\n",
       " \"The room is just the right size for 2 people. It had a sink, tv, mini fridge, small table and 1 tall chair plus a luggage holder. Bathroom is shared, 2 in each floor i think. There's no hair dryer so just bring one. Room is very clean, very simple. The place is just surrounded by homeless people, like a lot so just a heads up. But all in all, it was great for my 3 day trip! \",\n",

I'd stay again if it was again the least expensive place in the area close by where we were doing business ...which it was. \",\n",

It's clean and the staff is really friendly and nice. The lobbie smeals weird. The only bad thing is the homeless people around. You are going to find a lot of homeless people at the door and in the same street but I have to say that we hadn't got any problem with them. \\n\\n\",\n",

Beds are a little bit too small for two people that need space (for partners probably okay). Bathrooms don't have sinks so after toilet you either wash your hands in the shower or you wait until you get back to your room. But hey, when you're on a budget, these are probably just little things. Plus there is a great Thai restaurant further down the street.\",\n",

We ended up finding another hotel because we wanted to actually enjoy our stay. Worth closer to $35 IMO. Bummer to leave such a sour review, it was just our experience...',\n",

The area outside is not the cleanest, but it doesn't take long to walk through it to other spaces, and there are some welcoming bars and restaurants right in the immediate area. After dark the street life can get a little lively. I would stay here again, if I was doing something near this part of the city, but I would look into other spaces as well.

As most reviews suggesting, the street where the hotel is located, is full of homeless people. However, these people never talked to us or harassed us.

It is cleaned everyday. \\nThere is also no A/c in the room. I first asked the staff in the front desk for a fan, but they said they don’t have any. I then contacted the host and he asked me to pick it up at the front office. No issues after that. \\n\\nThere were also lots of fruit flies in the bathroom, which I wasn’t really bothered by so didn’t contact the host or the hotel staff. Overall, we felt safe and comfortable.  The hotel is what you will get for the price. Fresh towels will be provided. There is no iron or hair dryer, like other hotels. We didn't need it so we didn't ask for it. \\n\\n We were on the first floor, and it was really quiet.  If you are looking for something cheap, and don’t mind sharing bathrooms then I would recommend this place.  There is house keeping and 24hr staff at the front desk.
